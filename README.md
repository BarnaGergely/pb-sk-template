# PocketBase + Svelte Starter Template

This project is a pre configured starter template for creating and hosting self-hostable full-stack web applications using Pocketbase low-code backend and SvelteKit frontend framework.

This stack is designed to provide easy and effective development process for small web applications. You can create the backend and database with Pocketbase without coding and write the frontend with the relatively simple SvelteKit. It is a good all-in-one solution for hobby projects or for rapid prototyping.

You need to configure the database on the Pocketbase web dashboard and write the frontend code with SvelteKit. The PocketBase can host the static site generated by SvelteKit and the Svelte application on the client's browser can connect to the PocketBase API with the PocketBase JS SDK. This way the whole application integrated into one executable and can be hosted on any cheap VPS.

## Developing

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

### Setup development enviroment

1. Install NodeJS on your system
2. Clone the repository to you local system
3. Run `TODO` to download the latest PocketBase prebuilt binary
4. Run `npm install` to install the frontend's dependencies.

### Run Svelte development server

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Run PocketBase backend with the Svelte Frontend

1. Run `npm run build` to give the backend the prebuit Svelte frontend if you want to host the frontend and the backend in the same time
2. Run `TODO` to start the pocketbase

## Building for production

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build && TODO
```
